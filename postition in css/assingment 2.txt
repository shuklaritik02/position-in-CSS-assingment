 explain the difference between Absolute and Relative positioning .

 ans 
 Hereâ€™s a comparison between Relative and Absolute positioning:

Relative Positioning:

1.An element with position: relative; is positioned relative to its normal position.

2.Setting the top, right, bottom, and left properties of a relatively-positioned element will cause it to adjust away from its normal position.

3.Other content will not be adjusted to fit into any gap left by the element.

4.It moves an element relative to its original position without affecting the layout of other elements.

Absolute Positioning:

1.An element with position: absolute; is positioned relative to the nearest positioned ancestor (instead of positioned relative to the viewport, like fixed).

2.If an absolute positioned element has no positioned ancestors, it uses the document body, and moves along with page scrolling1.

3.It removes an element from the document flow and positions it relative to its nearest positioned ancestor3.
Absolute positioned elements are removed from the normal flow, and can overlap other elements1.
